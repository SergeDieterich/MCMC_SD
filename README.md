# MCMC_SD
MCMC codes for binary star astrometry from Dieterich et al. 2018, codes in IDL

The purpose of this MCMC suite of codes is to inferr the astrometric parameters
for trigonometric parallax, proper motion, and the 7 orbital elements based
on a list of astrometric displacements. Any combination of parameters can be
set to zero or to other fixed values so that any subset of the complete astrometric
motion can be solved. 

An example is provided in 'example_mcmc_sd.pdf' and is a good place to start.
See 'instructions_mcmc_sd_pdf' for a general outline, a description of which
code does what, and what options are available.
